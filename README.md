## Configuration needed

These settings need to be defined; default value for local development are fetched from configuration providers:

- **`SendGrid:Key`**

These settings can not be defined from Azure App Configuration / Azure Key Vault, and should be defined in `local.settings.json` **and** in hosting configuration as environment variables:

- **`AZURE_FUNCTIONS_ORGANIZATION`**
- **`AZURE_FUNCTIONS_APPLICATION`**
- **`AZURE_FUNCTIONS_ENVIRONMENT`**
- **`AZURE_FUNCTIONS_HOST`**
- **`AZURE_FUNCTIONS_KEYVAULT_VAULT`**

- **`ServiceBusConnectionString`**
